## Synopsis

An example of the ubiquitous **random quote generator** built on Express and deployed to Heroku.

The backgrounds are retrieved via the Unsplash.com API. Having not found a good quotation API, all of the quotations are contained within a JSON file and retrieved via a call to the server.

## Motivation

I would like to build up a portfolio of small projects. This is a contribution towards that goal.

## Installation

Clone the repo, then,

`npm install`

Add your Unsplash.com API key. Replace `YOUR_KEY` in the routes/images.js file with your own key. Then,

`npm start`

**Or...** You can [check it out on Heroku](http://ubiquitous-quote.herokuapp.com/)

## Feedback

I always appreciate any feedback that can be offered.
